This application was created based on the book by Guy Howard, a well-known author in dance circles, in order to facilitate the study of dance figures or quickly find the one you need. The application is built on the Nuxt framework. All component content is output to the Firebase database. Thus, the application loads quickly and is very convenient to use. The pages use dynamic components. The application uses grid, flex, and table layout. The application is adapted to all resolutions.
